#### SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a fundamental pillar in the world of digital marketing. Not only will it continue to be important in 2023, but its relevance will be accentuated by the growing digitalization of businesses, jobs, ventures and projects. As technology advances, SEO evolves to adapt to new trends and market needs.

#### The importance of having expert SEO professionals becomes more evident than ever. Given that SEO is a constantly expanding and extremely complex discipline, it is essential that those who have a thorough understanding of how social networks and search engines work are in charge of creating content with a high visibility potential.

#### SEO is not a recent development; has been around for over two decades and has stood the test of time. However, like many other disciplines, it must evolve and adapt to new technologies and trends to remain effective. SEO professionals must stay updated and be aware of all the news to continue positioning and creating successful content.

### The Six SEO Trends.

#### Quality Content: High quality content is essential. Search engines reward valuable and relevant content for users. Google has already implemented changes to penalize content without added value or full of spam. The key is to create original and unique content that stands out in your niche.

#### 1. Voice SEO: The trend of using voice commands will continue to grow in 2023. Voice command technologies detect keywords in the user's voice and show the results that best suit them. It is important to focus not only on keywords, but also on common phrases and natural expressions.

#### 2. Mobile User Priority: With approximately 57% of online browsing performed on mobile devices, it is essential to optimize SEO for mobile. Content must be adapted to mobile users, who are often short on time. This involves creating shorter texts and paragraphs, using keywords effectively, and optimizing web design for mobile devices.

#### 3. Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI is evolving at an impressive pace, and Google and other search engines are paying more and more attention to the intent behind content and its quality. This means that the quality of content and its relevance are essential for SEO, beyond simply focusing on keywords.

#### 4. Featured Snippets: Featured Snippets on Google are a great opportunity to make your content stand out. Although optimizing for this feature can be complicated, some strategies include using specific formats and researching frequently asked questions in your niche to create original, authoritative answers.

#### 5. Image Searches: SEO for images will continue to grow, especially driven by voice searches. It is essential to optimize your images with alt tags, captions, and ensuring they are properly categorized.
