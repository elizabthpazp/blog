# 7 React Hooks You
## Should Know

September 1, 2024

#### The most essential React hooks every frontend developer should know. From state management with useState to performance optimization with useMemo and useCallback, you'll understand how these hooks can transform the way you build React apps. You'll learn their use cases, practical examples, and best practices for implementing each of them in your projects.

### Introduction to React Hooks

#### React has revolutionized the way we build user interfaces, and one of the most powerful innovations it has brought is hooks. Introduced in version 16.8, hooks allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components, something that was previously only possible with class components.

#### For any developer working with React, understanding and mastering hooks is essential. Not only do they simplify code, but they also allow you to create more efficient and maintainable applications. In this article, we'll look at how these hooks can transform the way you develop your applications.

#### By the end of this read, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to apply these hooks in your projects, improving your workflow and taking your React development skills to the next level.

### 1. useState: Local State Management

#### This is a hook that allows you to add state to a functional component. It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function to update it.

```
import React, 
      { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
 const [count, setCount]=useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => 
    setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

### 2. useEffect: Side Effects and Lifecycle

#### This hook is used to perform side effects on functional components, such as subscribing to services, making data requests, or manipulating the DOM. It runs after the component is rendered.

```
import React, 
         { useEffect } from 'react';

function UpdateTitle() {
 const [count, setCount]=useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
   document.title = 
   `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]); 
}
```

### 3. useContext: Sharing Global State

#### Allows access to the React context, which allows values ​​(such as a theme or the authenticated user) to be shared between components without having to manually pass props through each level.

```
import React, 
       { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = 
      React.createContext('light');

function ThemedComponent() {
 const theme=useContext(ThemeContext);
  return ( 
    <div>Theme: {theme}</div>
  );
}
```

### 4. useReducer: Handling Complex State

#### This is similar to useState, but is useful for handling complex state or when state updates depend on a flow of actions. It uses a reducer to handle state updates based on the dispatched action.

```
import React, 
  { useReducer } from 'react';

function Counter() {
 const [count, dispatch] = 
 useReducer((state, action) => 
  state + action, 0);
  return <button onClick={() => 
   dispatch(1)}>
   Count: {count}</button>;
}

```

### 5. useRef: References and Value Persistence

#### It provides a way to access DOM elements directly or save mutable values ​​that do not require re-rendering the component when they change. It is also useful for keeping references to previous state values.

```
import React, 
      { useRef } from 'react';

function FocusInput() {
 const inputRef = useRef(null);
 const focusInput = () => {
  inputRef.current.focus();
 };
}

```

### 6. useMemo: Optimizing Expensive Calculations

#### This hook is used to memorize expensive calculations or functions to avoid recalculating them on every render, thus improving performance. It only recalculates the memorized value when its dependencies change.

```
import React, 
    { useMemo } from 'react';

function Square({ num }) {
 const result = useMemo(() => 
  num * num, [num]);
  return (
     <div>
       Square: {result}
     </div>
  );
}

```

### 7. useCallback: Memorize Functions for Performance

#### Memorize functions to avoid recreating them on every render. Useful when passing functions as props to child components that rely on the function reference to avoid unnecessary rendering.

```
import React, 
    { useCallback } from 'react';

function Button({ onClick }) {
 return <button onClick={onClick}
  >Click me</button>;
}

function Parent() {
 const handleClick = useCallback(() 
  => console.log('Clicked!'), []);
 return 
   <Button onClick={handleClick} />;
}

```

### Conclusions

![web development](./react-hooks1.jpg)

#### React hooks have become indispensable tools for any developer who wants to create modern and efficient frontend applications. Throughout this article, we've explored seven of the most important hooks, each offering unique capabilities ranging from state management to performance optimization. By understanding and applying hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext, you can simplify your components' logic, make your code more readable, and maintain a shared state without complications.

#### Additionally, hooks like useMemo and useCallback allow you to take your applications to the next level in terms of performance, avoiding unnecessary rendering and calculations. useReducer, on the other hand, provides you with a more structured way of handling complex states, especially useful in larger applications or with advanced state logic.

#### However, it's important to remember that the power of hooks also requires responsible use. Using them appropriately and in the right contexts ensures that your code remains clean and maintainable. With the knowledge you've gained about these hooks, you're better prepared to build more robust, efficient, and scalable React applications, taking full advantage of everything this library has to offer. As you continue to hone your use of hooks, you'll be strengthening your development skills and improving the quality of your projects.
